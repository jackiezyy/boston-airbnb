In this repo you'll find the analysis I did for the data scientist nanodegree using public data from Kaggle.

## Motivation
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. Boston, as a modern and cultural city, has thousands of properties listed. For travelers, Airbnb offers more home feelings and flexibility. For property owners, they can make money from vacant homes and meet people from around the world. With the popularity of Airbnb, it is very important for home owners to understand what could affect the listing prices.

1. What types of properties are most popular on airbnb?
2. What time of the year has the highest rental prices?
3. How can reviews affect prices?

## Summary of Results
- Entire townhouse can be listed at the highest price.
- Month of September and October have the highest rental prices.
- Most reviews are neutral and there is no negative reviews. Reviews have no effects on prices.

## Files
- Notebook with all codes: boston_airbnb_notebook
- Data: calendar.csv, listings.csv, reviews.csv
