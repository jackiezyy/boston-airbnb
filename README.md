In this repo you'll find the analysis I did for the data scientist nanodegree using public data from Kaggle.

1. What types of properties are most popular on airbnb?
2. What time of the year has the highest rental prices?
3. How can reviews affect prices?

## Summary of Results
- Entire townhouse can be listed at the highest price.
- Month of September and October have the highest rental prices.
- Most reviews are neutral and there is no negative reviews. Reviews have no effects on prices.
